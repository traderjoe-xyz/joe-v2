/// @notice Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
/// there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
/// specific functions. The ownership of this contract is transferred using the
/// push and pull pattern, the current owner set a `pendingOwner` using
/// {setPendingOwner} and that address can then call {becomeOwner} to become the
/// owner of that contract. The main logic and comments comes from OpenZeppelin's
/// Ownable contract.
///
/// By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
/// can later be changed with {setPendingOwner} and {becomeOwner}.
///
/// This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
/// `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
