# [JoeV2: Liquidity Book](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-v2)

This repository contains the Liquidity Book contracts, as well as tests and deploy scripts.

- The [LBPair](./src/LBPair.sol) is the contract that contains all the logic of the actual pair for swaps, adds, removals of liquidity and fee claiming. This contract should never be deployed directly, and the factory should always be used for that matter.

- The [LBToken](./src/LBToken.sol) is the contract is used to calculate the shares of a user, as the balance of an user fluctuates when he deposits or withdraws. The contract is an ERC-1155 like, without any callbacks for safety reason and allowing only sets of ERC20. An helper function to return an user's position was added to make liquidity management even easier.

- The [LBFactory](./src/LBPair.sol) is the contract used to deploy the different pairs and acts as a registry for all the pairs already created. It is also used for privileged function such as setting the parameters of the fees, the flashloan fee, setting the pair implementation, set if a pair should be ignored by the quoter and add new presets. Unless the `creationUnlocked` is `true`, only the owner of the factory can create pairs.

- The [LBRouter](./src/LBRouter.sol) is the main contract that user will interact with as it adds security checks. Most users shouldn't interact directly with the pair.

- The [LBQuoter](./src/LBQuoter.sol) is a contract that is used to return the best route of all those given. This should be used before a swap to get the best return on a swap.
